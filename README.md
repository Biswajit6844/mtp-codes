1)Install the  following  before  starting the project:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib2
genetica

2)For  running  of  DDPG  algorithm  without  NOMA follow  the  steps  below:
          a)Replace  the  NOMA  function  with the  uniform power  allocation principle  defined in the code  files .
          b)Run the  DDpG  algorithm.

3)For  running  of  DDPG  algorithm  with NOMA follow the  steps  below:
            a)Run the DDpg  algorithm  directly  first for  training  the actor   and  then  for training  the critic.

4)For  running  the Genetic  algorithm  without  NOMA follow the steps:
            a)Comment  the DDPG  algorithm  first
            b)Run the Genetic  algorithm  for  optimized  shifts.
            c)Then  Run the DDPg  algorithm.

5)For  running  the  Genetic  algorithm  with  NOMA  follow  the steps:
            a) Replace  the  NOMA  function  with the  uniform power  allocation principle  defined in the code  files .
